# My favourite character: Richard B. Riddick
Riddick is a former mercenary, soldier, and pilot, an infamous criminal and murderer who was finally captured by a bounty hunter named Johns.
 Johns wants to bring him to prison to collect his fee. 
Riddick has surgically altered eyes that allow him to see in the dark but need protection from daylight.
